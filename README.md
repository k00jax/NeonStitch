## 💳 Payments

Payments are handled via **Square**:
- **Card Payments** — Square Web Payments SDK
- **Cash App Pay** — Available through Square's payment platform

The API route at `/api/create-payment` processes payments server-side. The current implementation includes placeholder logic — uncomment the Square SDK calls and add your credentials to go live.

## 🎨 Theme

The site uses a dark theme (`#0a0a0f`) with neon accents defined as CSS custom properties:

| Color | Variable | Hex |
|-------|----------|-----|
| Pink | `--neon-pink` | `#ff1493` |
| Green | `--neon-green` | `#39ff14` |
| Blue | `--neon-blue` | `#00d4ff` |
| Yellow | `--neon-yellow` | `#fff01f` |
| Orange | `--neon-orange` | `#ff6600` |
| Purple | `--neon-purple` | `#bf00ff` |

## 🌐 Deployment

Deploy to Vercel:

```bash
npx vercel
```

Or connect your GitHub repo to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for automatic deployments.

Remember to add your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard under **Settings → Environment Variables**.

## 📝 Notes

- Product images currently use emoji placeholders. Replace the image areas in `ProductCard.tsx` and product detail page with actual product photos.
- Product data is in `src/lib/products.ts` — this can be migrated to a database later.
- The Etsy shop link points to [etsy.com/shop/neonstitchbyemily](https://www.etsy.com/shop/neonstitchbyemily).

## 🔄 Etsy Inventory Sync

NeonStitch supports webhook-driven Etsy inventory synchronization with idempotent delivery handling and background job processing.

- **Webhook endpoint**: `POST /api/webhooks/etsy`
- **Status endpoint**: `GET /admin/integrations/etsy/status`
- **Worker command**: `npm run worker:etsy`

### Setup Steps

1. Apply SQL migration in `migrations/20260226_etsy_inventory_sync.sql`.
2. Configure Etsy and DB environment variables in `.env.local`.
3. Register Etsy webhook subscription for inventory/listing updates to:
    - `https://<your-domain>/api/webhooks/etsy`
4. Start the worker process:
    - `npm run worker:etsy`

### Local Webhook Simulation

Run the sample sender script:

```bash
node scripts/send_etsy_webhook_sample.js
```

Optional payload file override:

```bash
node scripts/send_etsy_webhook_sample.js tests/etsy/fixtures/etsy-webhook-sample.json
```

The script signs payloads with `ETSY_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` and posts to `ETSY_WEBHOOK_URL` (default: `http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/etsy`).

### Import Etsy Products + Images

Generate local storefront product data from Etsy:

```bash
npm run import:etsy:products
```

- If `ETSY_API_KEY` and `ETSY_SHOP_ID` are set, the script uses Etsy API and pulls all active listings.
- Otherwise, it falls back to Etsy RSS (recent listings only).
- Output file: `src/lib/etsy-products.generated.json`
